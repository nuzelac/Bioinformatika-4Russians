In computer science, the Method of Four Russians is a technique for speeding up algorithms involving Boolean matrices, or more generally algorithms involving matrices in which each cell may take on only a bounded number of possible values.

Calculating edit distance between two strings and recovering a sequence of edit operations that achieves this minimal edit distance, execution time of those operation depends greatly on strings lengths.

Implemented solution applies Four Russians method to speed up execution of mentioned operations.
